/**
 *  Utility methods for creating the common game entities used by 
 *  the simulation.  In cases where a game entity may have multiple
 *  specific componnets or dependencies used to create it, it can be
 *  more convenient to have a centralized factory method.  Especially
 *  if those objects are widely used.  For entities with only a few
 *  components or that are created by one system and only consumed by
 *  one other, then this is not necessarily true.
