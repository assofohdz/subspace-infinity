# Refactor backlog

Bag of non-settings cleanup items — architecture splits, library audits, naming notes. Pull from this file when "what's next?" comes up for cleanup work that doesn't belong in the settings pipeline.

**Subspace-settings wiring lives in the pipeline tracker + work queue, not here:**
- [`settings-pipeline.md`](settings-pipeline.md) — what's wired, gate-by-gate
- [`settings-pipeline-slices.md`](settings-pipeline-slices.md) — what to work on next

## Naming / convention notes (kept for reference)

- **Spatial-name prefixes** — `WeaponsFireSystem.{BOMB,BULLET,MINE}_LEVEL_PREFIX` form `ShapeNames` strings the client maps to spatials. Framework convention; not a Pattern 4 candidate.
- **Default arena id** — `ArenaSystem.DEFAULT_ARENA_ID = "default"`. Framework convention.

## How to use this list

When the user asks "what's next?" or starts a new session asking about cleanup / refactoring opportunities, surface relevant items from this file. For Subspace-settings wiring, defer to the pipeline tracker + slices file.

**Keep this file in sync** — when an item lands, **delete** it from this file in the same commit. Do not strikethrough; crossed-out content is context-window clutter for future sessions.

**Not in this file** — Subspace-settings wiring lives in [`settings-pipeline.md`](settings-pipeline.md) + [`settings-pipeline-slices.md`](settings-pipeline-slices.md); pick from the queue file when settings work is the focus. RaM-pattern follow-ons live in [`replacement-as-mutation/PRD.md`](replacement-as-mutation/PRD.md). Spawn-projection harness expansion lives in [`spawn-projection-test-harness/PRD.md`](spawn-projection-test-harness/PRD.md).
