# Search / re-acquire

Status: needs-triage
Category: enhancement
Type: HITL

## Parent

[Bot behaviour catalog PRD](../PRD.md) — behaviour 07 of 30. Catalogued in [ADR-0016 §Combat](../../../docs/adr/0016-bot-behaviour-catalog.md). Phase 1.

## What to build

Register the `search / re-acquire` `Behaviour` ([ADR-0013](../../../docs/adr/0013-bot-tactical-goal-layer.md)) with its `synergy { }` entry ([ADR-0014](../../../docs/adr/0014-capability-derived-bot-composition.md)) and per-goal Execute Sequence. Target lost line-of-sight; move to its last-known tile and sweep to re-establish contact.

## Utility spec (from ADR-0016)

- **Hard gate:** `had_recent_target ∧ ¬los`
- **Situational fit:** `0.40 (target-recency) + 0.30 (last-known proximity) + 0.30 low_engagement`
- **Capability affinity (synergy `bonus`):** mobility, xRadar
- **Substrate read:** perception history + nav

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `search / re-acquire` `Behaviour` impl: `enumerate()` produces its goal candidates; `intrinsicScore()` implements the fit formula above over the ADR-0016 input vocabulary
- [ ] `synergy { }` entry in `engine-bot-ai.groovy`: `requires` + `bonus` matching the gate + affinity above; fit coefficients live in `engine-bot-ai.groovy`
- [ ] Goal record + `Execute<...>` BT sequence for carrying out the chosen goal
- [ ] Any input-vocabulary term this behaviour needs that is not already in the ADR-0016 table is added to the shared library + that table in the same change (never redefined inline)
- [ ] Weapon/item actions go through the canonical weapons/intent path (no AI bypass per ADR-0009 §3)
- [ ] Unit tests: `enumerate()` + `intrinsicScore()`; hard gate respected (ineligible ship never enumerates); Execute Sequence completes; goal expiry re-selects
- [ ] PMD ratchet on touched files
- [ ] Layer test passes
